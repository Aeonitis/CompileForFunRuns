/**
 * Stream pipelines may execute either sequentially or in parallel. This execution mode is a property of the stream.
 * Streams are created with an initial choice of sequential or parallel execution.
 * (For example, Collection.stream() creates a sequential stream, and Collection.parallelStream() creates a parallel one.)
 * This choice of execution mode may be modified by the BaseStream.sequential() or BaseStream.parallel() methods.
 * It is not documented by Oracle exactly what happens when you change the stream execution mode multiple times in a pipeline.
 * It is not clear whether it is the last change that matters or whether operations invoked after calling () parallel can be
 * executed in parallel and operations invoked after calling sequential() will be executed sequentially.
