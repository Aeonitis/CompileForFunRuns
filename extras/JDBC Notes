To use a third party JDBC driver for a database, steps take to retrieve a Connection using that driver in your JDBC program are:
- Put the driver jar in the class path.
- Retrieve a connection using DriverManager.getConnection.

Starting JDBC 4.0, the JDBC Driver class is not required to be loaded explicitly in the code any more.
Applications no longer need to explicitly load JDBC drivers using Class.forName().

The DriverManager methods getConnection and getDrivers have been enhanced to support the Java Standard Edition Service Provider mechanism.
JDBC 4.0 Drivers must include the file META-INF/services/java.sql.Driver. This file contains the name of the JDBC drivers implementation of java.sql.Driver.
For example, to load the my.sql.Driver class, the META-INF/services/java.sql.Driver file would contain the entry:
my.sql.Driver

When the method getConnection is called, the DriverManager will attempt to locate a suitable driver from
amongst those loaded at initialization and those loaded explicitly using the same classloader as the current applet or application.
