/**
 * TODO: Internal Invariants   You assert that a value is within a certain constraint.  assert x < 0  is
 * an example of an internal invariant. Class Invariants   You assert the validity of an objectâ€™s
 * state.
 *
 * TODO: Class invariants are typically private methods within the class that return a  boolean . The
 * upcoming  Rectangle  class demonstrates a class invariant.
 *
 * Control Flow Invariants   You assert that a line of code you assume is unreachable is never
 * reached. he upcoming  TestSeasons class demonstrates a control flow invariant.
 *
 * TODO: Preconditions You assert that certain conditions are met before a method is invoked.
 *
 * Post Conditions You assert that certain conditions are met after a method executes successfully.
 * The following example demonstrates a control flow invariant. Suppose that we have the following
 * enum  declaration. Notice how winter is missing from the list of seasons. This is intentional.
 * Our zoo is closed in the winter because it is too cold for visitors.
