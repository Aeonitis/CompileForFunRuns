/**
 * Starvation occurs when one thread cannot access the CPU because one or more other threads are
 * monopolizing the CPU. Thread starvation may be caused because of different thread priorities.
 *
 * A lower-priority thread can be starved by higher-priority threads if the higher-priority threads
 * do not yield control of the CPU from time to time.
 *
 * Starvation can occur due to the following reasons:
 * - Threads are blocked infinitely because a "greedy" thread takes long time to execute some synchronized code (e.g. heavy I/O operations or infinite loop).
 * - A thread does not get CPUâ€™s time for execution because it has low priority as compared to other threads which have higher priority.
 * - Threads are waiting on a resource forever but they remain waiting forever because other threads are constantly notified instead of the hungry ones.
