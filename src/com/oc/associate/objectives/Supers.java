 * Notes:
 * - Calling super(); is a call to the super class's constructor.
 * - You can't call the super class's constructor (or its own constructor) from a method (because by the time a method gets to run, the object has already been constructed), therefore calling super() from a method is not valid.
 * - super(); can only be the first statement of a constructor.
